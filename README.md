# search-algorithm-AI-
Those are some examples using the  method of searching to solve some classic problems in AI, such as Pitcher problem and  Missionaries and cannibals problem.
#
search.py is the fundemental and most imporatant code. It provides the algorithm which can be used by other codes to solve different 
    problems.
#
pitcher.py aims to solve The water pitcher puzzle. The water pitcher puzzle: Suppose that you are given a 3 quart pitcher and a 4 quart 
    pitcher.  Either pitcher can be filled from a faucet.  The contents of either pitcher can be poured down a drain.  Water may be poured 
    from one pitcher to the other. When pouring, as soon as the pitcher being poured into is full, the pouring stops.  There is no 
    additional measuring device and the pitchers have no markings to show partial quantities.Each operator returns a new instance of this 
    class representing the successor state.
#
missionary.py aims to solve the missionaries and cannibals problem. In the missionaries and cannibals problem, three missionaries and 
    three cannibals must cross a river using a boat which can carry at most two people, under the constraint that, for both banks, if there
    are missionaries present on the bank, they cannot be outnumbered by cannibals (if they were, the cannibals would eat the missionaries).
    The boat cannot cross the river by itself with no people on board.

You can use the search.py to solve more problems in AI! But it should be noted that it only provides an algorithm of brute force search, 
    wihch can be inefficient and even insoluble.
